= Zero Duration Idiom and Timer Tie

xtUML Project Design Note

== 1 Abstract

This note documents two idioms of circumventing the Shlaer-Mellor OOA
expedited event to self rule.  Changes to support this idiom are
described.  A separate change to the behavior of equal expiration timers
is also documented.

== 2 Introduction and Background

Shlaer-Mellor timers, delayed events, alarms, current clock and anyting
associated with time have subtle nuances.  The rule relating to
__expedited event to self__ is especially troublesome.

The following questions are addressed in this note:

* Does a timer with a zero duration mean something special?
* Is a delayed event to self expedited?
* Can/should the modeler control when an event to self is expedited?
* If a timer is started and has an expiration that matches an existing
  timer, does it matter whether it expires before or after the existing
  timer?

Answers provided below.

=== 2.1 Expedited Event to Self

In some literature we find "_accelerated_ event to self".  The OOA '96
Report <<dr-2>> uses the term _expedited_.

[quote,OOA '96 Report]
RULE (expedite self-directed events): If an instance of an object sends an
event to itself, that event will be accepted before any other events that
have yet to be accepted by the same instance.

The rule to expedite events to self seems to have assumed that this is
necessary and desireable in all cases.  However, modelers circumvent the
rule intentionally.  This is because the rule is undesirable in some
cases.  One case is a state machine that needs to repetitively operate for
a specific duration of time.

==== 2.1.1 Interruptible Self-Stimulating State Machine

A common pattern in Shlaer-Mellor modeling is the "interruptible
self-stimulating state machine".  This is a pattern in which a state
machine operates "as fast as it can" for a period of time or until another
state machine interrupts it.  After the prescribed duration or external
notification, the instance stops or does something different.

"Self-stimulating" in this context implies events directed to 'self'.

An example is a chess-playing 'bot which is allowed a specific, limited
amount of time to determine a best choice next move.  The algorithm
"thinks" "as fast as it can" for a specified duration.  When the time is
expired, it must play.  The algorithm is an instance state machine which is
looking ahead and generating events to itself to explore as many
possibilities as architecturally achievable in the allotted time.  When
the prescribed time is up, it must be interrupted by a timer event that
triggers a transition into a state in which the 'bot will play the best
candidate move it has identified in the allotted time.  This timer event
must interrupt the instance state machine, even though it is sending events
to 'self'.  The self events effectively "lock out" the timer event.

It could be argued that if timer events to self were also expedited, such
timer events would be delivered (interleaved with the self events).
However, this would only solve interruption by a timer event to self.  It
would still leave the state machine deaf to events from other instances
that wished to make the interruption.

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 Document Idioms

Explain the two known idioms for circumventing the expedited event to self
rule.

=== 3.2 Support Non-expedited Event Idioms in MC-3020

Support the Zero-duration Timer idiom for circumventing the expedited
event to self rule in MC-3020.

=== 3.3 Refine Timer Ordering

A bug has been identified in MC-3020 around the ordering of timers with
identical expirations.  Correct this bug.

== 4 Analysis

=== 4.1 Modeller Control of Expedition

Modelers have been circumventing the expedited event to self rule for many
years.  This note hopes to raise awareness of this practice and begin
settling on an agreed idiom.

=== 4.1.1 Idioms of Expedited Self-Directed Events

This author is aware of two idioms used to circumvent the expedited event
to self rule.  The first works only in MC-3020; the second looks clunky
but is more generally effective.

=== 4.1.1.1 Omission of 'self' Keyword

MC-3020 keys off of the 'self' keyword when translating a statement which
generates a delayed event.  By knowing this fact, the modeler can
circumvent the expedited event to self rule by assigning 'self' to a
transient variable before generating the event.  This is fine as long as
MC-3020 is the only architecture being used by the model.  This does not
work in Verifier, Ciera and MASL {cpp}, because those architectures check the
identifiers of the sending and receiving instances and expedite in all
cases that the identifiers are equal to each other.

=== 4.1.1.2 Zero-duration Timer

An uglier but more universally effective trick for circumventing the
expedited event to self rule is to schedule a delayed event with a
duration of zero.  This makes an (generally true) assumption that timer
events are never expedited.  This technique works in all known
architectures but may result in a small non-zero delay (which will be
corrected in MC-3020 by this work).

=== 4.2 Tie-break of Equal Expiration Timers

A loosely related bug was discovered in MC-3020 while investigating this
issue.  In the case in which a single instance has multiple timers waiting
to deliver delayed events, there is an ordering issue.  MC-3020 currently
(Summer 2024) queues a new timer _ahead_ of an existing timer when the
expiration times are identical.  It is marginally more efficient to do so,
because MC-3020 uses a linked list to maintain the sequence of ticking
timers.  However, it seems more natural to expire the existing timer ahead
of a new timer with the same expiration to maintain the order of
installation.  A modeler may make an assumption that the timer installed
first gets fired first when two timers have identical expiration times.
This may not be a good assumption by the modeler, but it seems natural.

This work will adjust this practice to align order of event delivery with
order of installation on timers with identical expirations.

== 5 Design

=== 5.1 Support of Zero-duration Timer Idiom

MC-3020 will be changed to detect a duration of zero.  In such cases,
installation of an actual timer will be skipped.  The event on the timer
will be queued immediately to the tail of the non-expedited event queue.

=== 5.2 Tie-break of Equal Expiration Timers

MC-3020 will be changed to order a new timer to follow an existing timer
with the same expiration.

== 6 Design Comments

Does a timer with a zero duration mean something special?::
Yes.  It means that the modeler is circumventing the expedited event to
self rule.  Such timers may be optimized to simply deliver the event
immediately but without expediting.

Is a delayed event to self expedited?::
No.  Since modelers use zero-duration delayed events to circumvent the
expedited event to self rule, timer events must never be expedited.

Can/should the modeler control when an event to self is expedited?::
Yes.  It should be the exception, but for certain patterns (one described
above), it is difficult and clumsy to build a model without the ability to
circumvent this rule.

If a timer is started and has an expiration that matches an existing timer, does it matter whether it expires before or after the existing timer?::
Yes.  The order of event delivery shall be the same as the order in which the timers were instantiated/created.
This may not be mandated by the Method, but it may be
reasonably assumed by modelers.  And since the order would not technically
matter, it seems reasonable to keep the ordering.
