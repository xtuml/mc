# Buffer Fixes and Customer Model Test Fixes
### xtUML Project Implementation Note


1. Abstract
-----------
Buffer management resulted in overruns discovered while fixing issues found
testing against customer models.  This change addresses the buffer issues
as well as a handful of other small issues.

2. Document References
----------------------
[1] Issues 22, https://github.com/xtuml/mc/issues/22  
    dynamically allocated events index memory incorrectly  
[2] Issues 23, https://github.com/xtuml/mc/issues/23  
    copying set transients can fail going out of scope  
[3] Issues 33, https://github.com/xtuml/mc/issues/33  
    potential deadlock in Escher_InsertElement  
[4] CQ DEI dts0101013957 - potential deadlock in Escher_InsertElement  
[5] Issues 39, https://github.com/xtuml/mc/issues/39  
    local return value has duplicate name  
[6] CQ DEI dts0101018323 - local return value has duplicate name  
[7] Issues 44, https://github.com/xtuml/mc/issues/44  
    incorrect setting of referential attributes  
[8] CQ DEI dts0101038821 - incorrect setting of referential attributes  

3. Background
-------------
While fixing [8] and [6], other issues were encountered.  [1] and [2]
had been fixed in previous work not marked in CQ.

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1  Get the size of buffers correct with dynamically created event memory.  
4.2  Do not allow set transients to go out of scope too soon.  
4.3  Manage semaphores one at a time.  
4.4  Provide uniqueness scheme that does not use info.uniquenum for return
     transient values.  
4.5  Set referentials correctly for simple reflexives.  

5. Work Required
----------------
     
6. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
6.1 For simple reflexives, the population of referential attributes was
    reversed.  While fixing this, an issue with subtype navigation was
    encountered for polymorphic events.  Fix the typo.  
6.2 Tested with a customer model (having foreign language character
    comments that expanded to be pretty huge) and ran into a record that
    was too long to process.  Increased the max record (SQL INSERT) from
    100000 bytes to 400000 bytes.  
6.3 Updates after testing with customer models.  Found and fixed an
    issue with include files for user supplied data types.  Corrected the
    relate statement across R2081.  Changed salt to use info found in V_PAR
    that should give the needed uniqueness.  
6.4 In q.sys.populate.arc, I found that ee_sort was being called before
    TE_EE_init.  So, we were sorting the unitialized list of EEs.  There were
    no sort keys!  
6.5 sysc/q.component.arc was still using the Description field rather than
    Descrip.  This change must have been missed in a previous issue.  

7. Unit Test
------------
7.1  Most of these issues are reproducible only in the customer shop.
     They have been reproduced and tested there.  
7.2  Run docgen on GPS Watch.
