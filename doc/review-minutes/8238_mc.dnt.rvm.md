-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
x- 01 min BM 2.2       add link
x- 02 min BM 3         strike sentence 2
x- 03 min CS 5.1       reword 5.1 to note reconciliation is against model elements, not graphic elements
x- 04 maj LS 6         We could populate the model of MASL and use that to help create and tie the model data to the graphics data
Actually, graphics data needs to be linked (by ID) to the xtUML meta-model instances.  So using the model of MASL does not help.
x- 05 min KB 6.2.1     There are multiple 6.2.1s
x- 06 min KB 6.2       "a number model element" > "a number of model elements"
x- 07 min BM 6.2       Rework.  The model of graphics includes DIM_* and others.
x- 08 min CS 6         There is no discussion or consideration in this document of components as graphical containers
x- 09 min KB general   Datatypes will need "figure"s created also
x- 10 min BM 6.4       Call out that we are purposefully making the relationship from coupler to widget a 1..* instead of 0..*
x- 11 min LS 6.5, 6.6  Minor formatting note.  Add line break after section header
x- 12 min LS 6.8       "shave" > "have"

Major observations, a re-review is required.
