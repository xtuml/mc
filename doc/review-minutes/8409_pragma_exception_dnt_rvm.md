-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
x- 01  min   CDS  3        Last sentence "is" -> "are"
x- 02  min   SKB  5.1.3    Discussed reasons for markables to be flexible and loosely coupled to the application model
x- 03  min   SKB  6.1.3    Check if role phrase is on both sides
x- 04  min   CDS  7        Note that the mode of MASL says domain "defines" exception (should be domain "declares" exception)
x- 05  min   SKB  6.1.*    Describe the 'Name' attribute (key letters of the class)
_- 06  min   all  6.1.*    Fix the model so that Mark is uniquely identified (more than one Mark for each instance of an OOA class)
x- 07  min   LPS  6.1.4    Expound on what you describe with the 'Path' attribute (add reference?)
_- 08  maj   Bob  6.*      Specify how marks are persisted
_- 09  maj   all  *        Explore persistence, packaging, uniquely identifying marks
x- 10  min   SKB  6.2.2    Survey ALF to inform decision about how to link Exception in [It does not look like Alf supports exceptions, yet.  I searched the spec.  There is one occurence of 'exception' and zero of 'exceptions'.]

Major observations were recorded, a re-review is required.
