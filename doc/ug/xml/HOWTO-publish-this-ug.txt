How to Publish this User Guide
-------------------------------
This user guide is distributed inside the BridgePoint release.  The guide is 
pulled in as an "extra file" during the build creation.  This means that it is
not rebuilt as part of the nightly BridgePoint plugin build.  It is static data
that the nightly build process pulls in.

This static data, in the form of a zipfile containing the HTML documentation, is
built and placed manually whenever someone edits the documentation.  The steps
below detail how to do this.


1) Setup.  This process requires the docbook xslt processor.  You can either use
   the native one inside cygwin or linux, or you can use the one distributed
   inside a BridgePoint installation.  The native one for cygwin is in the 
   cygwin "libxslt" package.  The BridgePoint one is found beneath
   C:\MentorGraphics\BridgePoint\tools\docgen\docbook.
   
2) Steps to generate HTML:
    _- open a terminal/shell
    _- cd <CVS>/MC-Documentation/external/mc3020/ug/xml
    _- xsltproc --nonet --novalid ug.xsl ug.xml
    
3) Package the HTML:
    _- mkdir /tmp/3020ug
    _- mv *.html /tmp/3020ug
    _- cp *.png /tmp/3020ug
    _- cd /tmp/3020ug
    _- zip -q -r mc3020_doc.zip .
    
4) Upload the new docs
    _- ftp put the mc3020_doc.zip to ftp://mentorweb/pub/BP/dropoff
    _- ssh <userid>@tucson.wv.mentorg.com
    _- cd /arch1/products/tiger/extra_files_for_build
    _- mv mc3020_doc.zip old_file/mc3020_doc.zip.<date>
    _- wget ftp://mentorweb/pub/BP/dropoff/mc3020_doc.zip 
    _- chmod 664 mc3020_doc.zip
