HOWTO Create the Special Branch for the Model Compilers and DocGen
===

---
This note describes the steps to create the special branch used for the model
compilers and DocGen along with instructions for generating the model compiler
schema and the graphical meta-model that ships with the tool.

---

Creating the Branch
--------------------
* It is suggested to create a new workspace for this work when you start eclipse
* Switch to model explorer
* Make sure Build Automatically is OFF
* Clone xtuml/mc
* models/mcooa is the MC metamodel.  models/escher is the MC functionality.
  models/docgen has the docgen functionality.  models/Document has the
  document model.  models/mcshared has common types and EEs.

    
    
Generating the Schema
---------------------
* Clone xtuml/pyxtuml (git clone https://github.com/xtuml/pyxtuml.git)
* sudo setup.py
* python .../xtuml<fork>/pyxtuml/examples/gen_ooaofooa_schema.py .../xtuml<fork>/mc/model/mcooa/models/ | sed "s/Action_Semantics_internal/Action_Semantics/" > .../xtuml<fork>/mc/schema/sql/xtumlmc_schema.sql
* Compare (git diff) the newly created schema file with the existing version.
  Make sure all the changes make sense.
  There may be an attribute that does not get generated (ACT_ACT:return_type),
  because it is something not supported by pyxtuml, yet.
   
   

Exporting the Model for Customers
----------------------------------
* See org.xtuml.bp.welcome/README.txt



Building DocGen
---------------
* See ./HOWTO Create docgen exe.txt



NOTES
-----
* We have seen cases in the pase of orphaned referential attributes on the 
  Translation Extensions Class Diagram after merging.  If any are found, 
  unformalize and re-formalize the necessary association.
