HOWTO Create the Special Branch for the Model Compilers and DocGen
===

---
This note describes the steps to create the special branch used for the model
compilers and DocGen along with instructions for generating the model compiler
schema and the graphical meta-model that ships with the tool.

---

Creating the Branch
--------------------
* It is suggested to create a new workspace for this work when you start eclipse
* Switch to model explorer
* Make sure Build Automatically is OFF
* Check out bp.core (or replace bp.core with the latest) from HEAD
* Branch bp.core to MC-<name>
* Switch to Java perspective
* Delete the following files and directories:
  * Code packages underneath src/
  * arc/
  * color/
  * contexts/
  * doc/
  * icons/
  * md/
  * schema/
  * sql/
  * tools/
  * generate_context_menus.bat
* Merge bp.core with the previous version of the MC-<name> branch
  * Merge in the new files under src/
  * Merge in the updates (if any) in .externalToolBuilders/
  * Merge in the updates under gen/
  * Merge in the updates under libsrc/
  * Merge in the updates under META-INF/
  * Merge in the updates to .classpath
  * Merge in the updates to .cproject
  * Merge in the updates to .project
  * Merge in the changes to the MC-specific additions under models/ :
    * context_menu
    * DocGen
    * Document
    * Document Data Types
    * Instance Reference Data Types
    * Local
    * MC
    * MCfunctions
    * RuntimeValue
    * Search
      * Engine
      * Participation
      * Query
      * Result
    * Translation Extensions
    * Translation Marking
    * Translation OAL
    * ooaofooa_hierarchy
  * You may need to merge ooaofooa.xtuml to pick up changes to domain.
  * Any other model conflicts (ooaofooa and Datatypes) should most likely be 
    ignored.  Select them all and choose "Mark as Merged" from the context menu.
  * Sometimes the xtUML Model perspective gets confused at this point and a
    restart is required.

    
    
Generating the Schema
---------------------
* Go to Properties->Builders and turn off all builders except for
  the Model Compiler Pre-Build and Model Compiler.
* From the C/C++ Projects perspective, find .externalToolBuilders and refresh.
* Expand `src/`.  If `xtumlmc_schema.sql` is not the same as the latest versioned
  copy of the file, copy the file to an appropriately versioned file in the same
  folder.
* Build Project now, this will generate the schema.
* Fix up the schema by hand
  1.  E_GEE... somebody re-formalized an association and switched the order
      (at some point).  But, E_GEE is not supported by the tool, so leave this
      one alone.
  2.  O_RAVR gets deleted. It has no attributes and generator can't handle this.
  3.  Places where C (conditionality) has been added is because we have gotten 
      MC errors that we should not.  In some cases, it's possible the ooaofoaa 
      is wrong but have not resolved.
  4.  ROP TE_SWC to O_OBJ.  Cort forgets exactly why we make this change, but 
       there is a reason.
* Compare the newly created schema file with the existing version.  Make sure 
  all the changes make sense.
   
   

Exporting the Model for Customers
----------------------------------
* See com.mentor.nuclues.bp.welcome/README.txt



Building DocGen
---------------
* See ./HOWTO Create docgen exe.txt



NOTES
-----
* We have seen cases in the pase of orphaned referential attributes on the 
  Translation Extensions Class Diagram after merging.  If any are found, 
  unformalize and re-formalize the necessary association.
